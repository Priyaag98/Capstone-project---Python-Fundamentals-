# Working on Python Fundamentals
## 📌 Overview

This project is a Python Fundamentals Capstone focused on real-world data analysis and data manipulation using Python. The objective was to simulate a business scenario involving employees, projects, and organizational hierarchy data.

The project involved creating multiple datasets, performing data cleaning, transformation, and analytical operations using Python libraries. The workflow demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis pipeline including data preparation, feature engineering, business rule implementation, and analytical reporting.

Three datasets were used:
- Employee Data
- Project Data
- Seniority Level Data

The final goal was to combine these datasets and derive meaningful insights through structured data processing and logical operations.
